# Bizmates Technical Exam, The weather App by Jonathan Espanol

The weather app was built on top of Laravel and VueJS. The UI was pretty simple yet it has the essential feature that is needed by the user, which is to search for the tourist spot in japan. The user will have select the cities by on select box and after clicking the submit, the page will display the weather information of the city and its top 5 recommended places. 

Having a simple page with simple background would not be catchy to the user if the designer has poor choice of fonts, in the latest trend of UX, the right choice of typography is really is having a big impact.

The UI is also mobile ready.

The user experience would be very intuitive by giving all to options that the user only need, nothing will have to distract them when they try to explore the site.
